Topic: Code refactoring.
Context: The code is a part of a project involving a timeline component in an IDE plugin. The existing code defines a class `TimeLine` that extends `JPanel` and displays a timeline based on a list of events. The task is to add a new method `addPointInTimeLine` that will add a new event to the existing timeline.
Intent: Modify the code to add a method for adding new events to the timeline while keeping the existing events intact.
Named Entities: None.
Keywords: add, method, `addPointInTimeLine`, new event, timeline, previous events.
Sentiment: Neutral.

Code Solution:
```
fun addPointInTimeLine(newEvent: Event) {
    events.add(newEvent)
    eventPoints.add(Triple(newEvent.time.hour, newEvent.description, newEvent.isUser))
    repaint()
}
```

Follow Up Question: What would be the signature of the `Event` class used in the `addPointInTimeLine` method?
Next Logical Follow Up Question: Can you provide an example of how to call the `addPointInTimeLine` method to add a new event to the timeline?
