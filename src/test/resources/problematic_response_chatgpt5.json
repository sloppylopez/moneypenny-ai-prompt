Refactored Code:
package com.example.projectname.services

import kotlin.math.sqrt

class StringsService {

fun filterPrimeNumbers(numbers: Array<Int>) = numbers.filter(::isPrime)

private fun isPrime(number: Int) = number > 1 && (2..sqrt(number.toDouble()).toInt()).none { number % it == 0 }
}
- Since the given code is already following best practices and already using one-liners where possible, there is no need for further DRY refactoring.
