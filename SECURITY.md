## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

At MoneyPenny AI Prompt, we take security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any security vulnerabilities you may find in our project. This helps us ensure the safety and integrity of our software for all users.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps to report it:

1. **Do Not Disclose Publicly:** Avoid posting the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it.

2. **Submit a Report:** Please report the security issue privately by sending an email to [sloppy@sloppylopez.com].

3. **Include Details:** In your report, include a detailed description of the vulnerability, the affected versions, and steps to reproduce the issue if applicable. This information will help us understand and address the problem faster.

4. **Responsiveness:** We will acknowledge your report as fast as possible and keep you updated on the progress of the fix.

5. **Disclosure Policy:** Once the issue has been resolved, we will work together to determine the appropriate time to publicly disclose the vulnerability. We appreciate your patience and cooperation in this process.

## Responsible Disclosure

We encourage responsible disclosure and request that you:

- Provide ample time for us to address the issue before disclosing it publicly.
- Do not exploit the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the security flaw.

We are committed to working with security researchers to address any vulnerabilities promptly and will acknowledge your efforts in our list of acknowledgments and credits.

Thank you for helping us ensure the security and safety of our project. Your contributions are highly valued!
